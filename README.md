### Personal website about me and my projects.

In this project, I've:
* used FlexBox and Grid to place blocks on the page,
* made the page adaptive for different devices from mobile to large screens,
* used the BEM methodology working with tags and the file structure.

## Installation
* Run `GitBash` (or `Terminal` on MacOS);
* Select or create a new repository where you want to put the project;
* Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/IrinaSfv/irinasafarova.git`;
* Open the project in any convenient code editor.

## Usage
You can view the current version of the page by following the link:
### [Irina's Portfolio](https://irinasfv.github.io/)

## To-do
* Add functionality for opening and closing pop-up with form when clicking on the `Contact me` button;
* Add validation and form submission to the server;
* Add functionality to switch between languages without opening another page.
